The data for each election is in the *.db file named for that year.
Each file is an SQLite database file with five tables:

ridings:
(riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT, winning_party TEXT, margin REAL, total_votes INTEGER)

Notes:
- riding_id is the electoral district number provided by Elections Canada
- winning_party is the party code of the party that won the polling division. See common_defs.py
  for a list of codes
- margin is the margin of victory for the winning party in that riding

candidates:
(cand_id INTEGER, riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT, party TEXT)

Notes:
- cand_id is not provided by the data files and is generated in the loading code
- riding_id is a reference to a row in the table ridings
- party is a "party code", as given in common_defs.py. Examples: LIB, CON, OTH, etc.

poll_divisions:
(div_num INTEGER, div_suffix INTEGER, riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT, winning_party TEXT, margin REAL, total_votes INTEGER)

Notes:
- div_num and div_suffix uniquely identify the poll division. They correspond to PD_NUM and PD_NBR_SFX
  respectively in the shapefiles.
- riding_id is a reference to a row in the table ridings
- winning_party and margin are the same as their respective columns in ridings

riding_candidates:
(cand_id INTEGER, riding_id INTEGER, result INTEGER)

Notes:
- this is the relationship between the ridings table and the candidates table.
- cand_id and riding_id are the same as their respective variables in ridings and candidates
- result is the reported vote count for that candidate in that riding

poll_candidates:
(cand_id INTEGER, riding_id INTEGER, div_num INTEGER, div_suffix INTEGER, result INTEGER)

Notes:
- similar to riding_candidates, with the addition of a polling division identifiers
